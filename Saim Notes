____________________________________________________________

Custom Classes
Static
____________________________________________________________

Static

	instance: belongs to the object
		every object has its own copy of the members

	static: belongs to the class
		there is a single copy of the members shared with the class, and all objects of that class

	Ex:

		public class Water{

			int amount;

			static String planet = "Earth";

		}

class: Water
instance variable: amount
static variable: planet

Static members:
	variables
	methods
	blocks
	class

To access any static member use the className.static

Note: Objects of a class can access the static members, but it is not recommended

		Water obj = new Water();
		Water.planet; --> proper way to access this variable
		obj.planet; --> works, but not recommended

Static methods:

	methods: doing some actions

	static method: you can do the actions without needed an object. Use just the class name
		-> there is a single copy of this method belonging to the class

		ex:

			Arrays.toString()
			Arrays.sort()
			String.join()

		Use case: utility classes, group useful methods into one file
			Ex: Arrays, Collections

	instance method: you must create an object in order to use these methods. Accessed by the object
		-> every object has a copy of this method

		ex:

			new Scanner().nextInt()
			String s = "java";
				s.charAt()
				s.length()

Static block

	code block that will be executed once in the beginning when the class is used for the first time

	static {
		// code
	}

	can be used to initialize static variables

Day 44 Custom Classes

day44_custom_classes
____________________________________________________________

Custom Classes
Constructor 
____________________________________________________________

Constructor 

	a special method that is executed when the object is created
	does not have a return type
	run one time
	usually used to initialize the object, set the initial values to the instance variables

	public class Paper{

		public Paper(){

		}

	}

class: Paper

constructor:

	Paper(){

	}

calling the constructor to create an object

	new Paper() --> this creates an object of the Paper class and it does this by calling the constructor from that class

overloading the constructor
	
	create multiple constructors in a class by making different constructors with different parameters

	-> this means you create different ways to make the objects of the class

this keyword

	it is a reference to the objects/instance of the class 

	mainly used to tell the compiler the difference between a instance variable and a local variable

		-> java prioritizes the local variables

	any variables made in a method, loop, if statement etc, is a local variable which belongs to that code block. It is available to use until the close bracket

	instance variable belonging to each object. Make object to use those variables

constructor chaining

	constructor calling another constructor in the same class

	this()

	helps to reduce repetition

	rules:

		- constructor call must be on the first line
		- cannot do more than one constructor call
		- constructor cannot call itself or contain itself
			-> the constructor that is called should not call back to current constructor 
		- this() can only be used in a constructor 

this vs this()

	this: reference to instance members: instance variable and instance methods

	this(): call another constructor

Day 43 Custom Classes

day43_custom_classes
____________________________________________________________

Custom Classes
____________________________________________________________

A class is a blueprint/template for objects

A class can define data or actions

	data: instance variables
	action: instance methods

An object is an instance of a class
	physical copy of a class

	creating an object is called instantiation

instance members belong to objects
	do not have static

instance variables
	every object will have a copy of the instance variables

	memory: objects are created in the heap

	instance variables have default values

toString()

	a method that allows us to print our objects 

	the method returns a String that is made of the information of a method

	this method is called automatically when printing
		by default the objects print the memory location

Example class and object

Room.java
	public class Room {

		int doors;
		boolean hasFan;
		double length;
		double width;

		public void goToRoom(){
			// code
		}

		public String toString(){
			return "Room has " + doors + " doors.";
		}

	}

Class: Room
instance variables: doors, hasFan, length, width
instance methods: goToRoom, toString
toString(): will print how many doors the room object has

UseRoom.java
	public class UseRoom {

		public static void main(String [] args){
			Room livingRoom = new Room();
			livingRoom.doors = 4;
			livingRoom.instanceVariable; // general syntax
			livingRoom.instanceMethod(); // general syntax
			System.out.println(livingRoom);
		}

	}

Object reference: Room livingRoom
Actual Object: new Room();
Accessing instance members:
	livingRoom.instanceVariable;
	livingRoom.instanceMethod();

When printing the object directly: 
	System.out.println(livingRoom); --> Room has 4 doors

	-> If we did not make our own toString() in the class then we would see only some memory information

____________________________________________________________

Constructor

	a special method that is called when the objects are created
		-> constructors do not have a return type

	syntax:

		public ClassName(){

		}

	constructor is used with the new keyword to create objects

		Ex:
			new ClassName() --> calls the constructor from the class

			constructor is called once when object is created

	one of the main uses of a constructor is to initialize the instance variables of an object
		-> sets up an object when being created

	if no constructor is made manually, then the compiler has a default constructor that has no arguments
		-> if you make a constructor the default constructor is not there anymore

	Item.java
		
		public class Item{

			String name;
			double price;

			public Item(String inputName, double inputPrice){
				name = inputName;
				price = inputPrice;
			}

		}

class: Item
instance variables: name, price
constructor: 
	public Item(String inputName, double inputPrice){ }

		-> in this example has 2 parameters
			inputName and inputPrice are local to the constructor 

assigning the value to the instance variable from the parameters
			name = inputName;
			price = inputPrice;

	UseItem.java

		public class UseItem{

			public static void main(String [] args){

				Item item = new Item("Pen", 1.5);

			}
		}

class: UseItem
creating an Item object with reference: Item item = new Item("Pen", 1.5);
		
	 new Item("Pen", 1.5); -> creating an object

	 	calls the Item constructor with 2 arguments

	 	The order of the arguments matters. 
	 	"Pen" is the value used for inputName
	 	1.5 is the value used for the inputPrice
____________________________________________________________

this keyword

 	it is a reference to the object/instance

 	mainly it used to tell the compiler the difference between local variables and instance variables

 	when there was variables in different levels, with the same name, java prioritizes the local variables

public class Address {

    String street;
    String city;
    String state;
    String zipcode;

    // unique parameter names

//    public Address(String inputStreet, String inputCity, String inputState, String inputZipcode){
//        street = inputStreet;
//        city = inputCity;
//        state = inputState;
//        zipcode = inputZipcode;
//    }

// 	same parameter names as instance variables

    public Address(String street, String city, String state, String zipcode){
        this.street = street; // assigning the value of the local street from the parameters to the instance variable street
        this.city = city;
        this.state = state;
        this.zipcode = zipcode;
    }

}

____________________________________________________________

Constructors can be overloaded

	overloading means to have different parameters

	enables you to create objects in different way and with different data

	Ex:

		new ArrayList<>()
		new ArrayList<>(collection type)
		new ArrayList<>(capacity)


String str=new String("apple") is it constructor? yes

What is a class?
	
	a template/blueprint for objects. It will have data and actions

	the class name must match the file name

What is an object?

	instance of a class - meaning a copy of the class

	each object has a copy of all the information in a class

What is an instance variable?

	variables made in a class

	these variables belong to the objects of the class
		-> Each object has its own copy of the variables

What is static?
	
	belongs to the class

	instance: object
	static: class

How to create an object?

	ClassName referenceName = new ClassName();

	instantiation: creating an object
		in-stan-shi-ation
____________________________________________________________

Example class and objects:

Student.java

		public class Student{
			
			String name;
			int batchNumber;
			int groupNumber;
			boolean inEveningBatch;

			public void study(){
				System.out.println("Studying");
			}

		}

Student is the class
name, batchNumber, groupNumber, and inEveningBatch are the instance variables 
study() is an instance method

Zoom.java

		public class Zoom {
			
			public static void main(String [] args){
				Student studentOne = new Student();
				studentOne.name = "James";
				studentOne.study();
			}
		}

Student studentOne = new Student(); this line is creating an object of the Student class
studentOne.name = "James"; this line is accessing the instance variable name from the studentOne object
studentOne.study(); this line calls the instance study() method from the studentOne

____________________________________________________________

How to print the objects

	by default if you try to print an object it will give some memory location

	Ex: 	Student obj = new Student();
			obj.name = "James";
			obj.batchNumber = 26;
			System.out.println(obj); --> memory location

	all classes have a method called toString which is automatically called when printing

	so if we made the toString method in the Student class:

		public String toString(){
			return name + " " + batchNumber
		}

	now if we print the object: 

		System.out.println(obj); -->  James 26

Shortcut:

	DO NOT WORRY ABOUT @OVERRIDE
	
	right click in the class -> generate option -> toString -> select the variables you want to include

	shortcut for generate window
		command + n (mac)
		alt + insert

Java prioritizes local variables

	if there is a local variable and an instance variable that have the same name the local variable is the one used

Day 40 ArrayList

day40_arraylist
____________________________________________________________

ArrayList
____________________________________________________________

ArrayList

	a part of the collection framework

	Creating ArrayList objects

		ArrayList<type> name = new ArrayList<>();

			-> makes an empty ArrayList 

		ArrayList<type> name = new ArrayList<>( int );

			-> make an ArrayList with int number of capacity 

				size: how many elements there is 
				capacity: internal storage to be used
					default capacity is 10

		ArrayList<type> name = new ArrayList<>( collection type );		

			-> it will create an ArrayList with the values from the given collection type

			--> collection type: so far we only know ArrayList

				ArrayList<type> name = new ArrayList<>( ArrayList );	

		Q: Are array objects a collection type

			No, they are not in the collection framework, but we can use the Arrays utility class to help us convert an array into a collection type

				INVALID --> ArrayList<type> name = new ArrayList<>( array [] );	
				VALID 	--> ArrayList<type> name = new ArrayList<>( Arrays.asList( array []) );	

		Arrays.asList()
			parameters: array objects (var arg)
			return: collection type

			Note: this method is a var arg method, so we are able to type elements in the parenthesis and those will be taken as the array elements

	ex of var arg method

		normal: public static void method(int [] arr)
			to call this method you must give an array object

			int [] a = {4, 5, 1, 2};
			method(a)

		var arg: public static void method(int ... arr)
			to call this method you can either give an array object,
			or type the element values right away with commas

			int [] a = {4, 5, 1, 2};
			method(a)

			or

			method(4, 1, 5, 1);

More ArrayList methods:

	bulk operation methods:

		the arguments of these methods are collection types

		addAll(collection type): add all of the given collection type elements to the ArrayList
		removeAll(collection type): remove all the elements that match from the argument
		containsAll(collection type): checks if the ArrayList contains all of the defined elements from the argument
		retainAll(collection type): keep all matching elements from the argument. The rest are removed

Collections

	a utility class for collections

	located in the java.util package

	https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Collections.html

	there is no sort method in ArrayList
		ArrayListObject.sort() is not valid

		ArrayObject.sort() is not valid

	Collections.sort(collection type): sort the given collection
		void method

	Collections.reverse(collection type): reverse the order of the elements in given collection	
		void method

	Collections.max(collection type): returns the biggest elements in the collection
		returns int

	Collections.min(collection type): returns the smallest elements in the collection
		returns int

	Collections.swap(collection type, index1, index2): swap the elements in the collection based on the defined indices. The element in index1 is put into the index2 and vice versa
		return void

	Collections.frequency(collection type, element): return how many times the given element is found in the collection
		returns int

Day 39 ArrayList

day39_arraylist
____________________________________________________________

Tomorrow: No Class
____________________________________________________________

ArrayList
____________________________________________________________

ArrayList methods:
	
	add(element) --> adds the element to the end of the ArrayList
		returns boolean

	add(index, element): puts the element at the given index number. All the other elements are moved over
		void

	get(index) --> returns the element at the given index

	size() --> returns how many elements the ArrayList has

		last index in ArrayList: name.size() - 1

	remove(index): removes the element at the given index number and returns that element value 
		-> what if you try to remove with an index that doesn't exist: it will go out of bounds

	remove(element): removes the given element and returns a boolean value if it was removed or not
		-> what if you try to remove with an element that doesn't exist: the list will not be changed and the method would return false

Iterating through an ArrayList

	ArrayList<Integer> nums = new ArrayList<>();
	nums.add(1);
	nums.add(2);
	nums.add(3);

	for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++){
		System.out.println(nums.get(i));
	}

	or

	for(int each : nums){
		System.out.println(each);
	}

____________________________________________________________

Example of adding, removing

        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("computer");
        list.add("screen");
        list.add("mouse");
        list.add("keyboard");

        String item = list.remove(0); // removes the first index of the ArrayList, which is (computer) and it returns that element (computer) from the method. We store the return value into a String variable called item
        System.out.println(item);
        System.out.println(list);

        boolean bool = list.remove("mouse");
        System.out.println(bool);
        System.out.println(list);

____________________________________________________________

More ArrayList methods:

	contains(element): check if the given element is in the ArrayList. Return boolean. True if the element is there or false if it is not

	clear(): remove all the elements in the ArrayList

		void: no return

	isEmpty(): return boolean. 
		true: whenever there is no element in the ArrayList
		false: whenever there is any element in the ArrayList

	set(index, element): replace the element at the given index number (1st parameter) with the given element (2nd parameter)

	indexOf(element): return an int
		first occurrence of the index of the given element

		if the element does not exist in the ArrayList: it returns -1

____________________________________________________________

Convert an Array to an ArrayList

	for array we were able to declare values using curly brackets

		int [] a = { 1, 2, 3, 4};

	We can't just do this for ArrayList

	But ArrayList can be made in other ways:

		ArrayList<type> name = new ArrayList<>(); // makes empty ArrayList, no elements

		ArrayList<type> name = new ArrayList<>( ArrayList object ); // make an ArrayList with a copy of the elements from another ArrayList

			--> this one is more generic: 
			ArrayList<type> name = new ArrayList<>( collection type );

	so

		we can use Arrays.asList() method which accepts an array parameter and return a collection type

	All the points combined:

		ArrayList<type> name = new ArrayList<>( Arrays.asList() );

		this will create a new ArrayList object by giving values into the asList method

Note: the asList method is a var arg method, which means the parameter is an array, but we can add the numbers ourselves using the element and a comma

	method(int ... nums) --> same as --> method(int [] nums)

	but the ..., the var arg method allow you to type the element in the parenthesis

Day 38 ArrayList

day38_arraylist
____________________________________________________________

ArrayList
____________________________________________________________

Recap

Wrapper Classes

	object representation of primitive datatypes 

	these classes are in the java.lang package

Converting types

	Autoboxing: converts the primitive datatype into an object type (Wrapper Class Objects)

	Unboxing: converts the object type into a primitive datatype

When to use Wrapper classes

	1) ArrayList and other collections can't work with primitive datatypes

	2) Useful methods, information 

		Ex: parse methods, MAX_VALUE

____________________________________________________________

ArrayList

	a class that works like a dynamic array that also has some methods

	located in the java.util package
		--> Anytime you want to use an ArrayList you must import it

	the size is flexible
	we can print the ArrayList objects normally 
	only work with Objects type --> primitive datatypes do not work 

	ArrayList will take more memory than an array
	Arrays itself is faster, whenever there is set of data that doesn't change

	Syntax:

		ArrayList<datatType> name = new ArrayList<>();

ArrayList methods:

	add(element): add the given element to the ArrayList at the end

		returns boolean --> returns true, but we don't normally use this return value

	add(index, element): adds the given element at the given index of the ArrayList. All elements are moved positions

	get(index): returns the element at the given index number

	size(): returns the number of how many elements the ArrayList has

	remove(index): remove the element at the given index and it returns the element that was removed
		all the elements move over

	remove(element): remove the given element from the ArrayList and it returns a boolean
		true -> remove an element
		false -> element doesn't exist

Day 36 Overloading Methods

day36_methods
____________________________________________________________

Overloading methods
____________________________________________________________

Method overloading

How to have methods with similar idea, first we can try with different name:
but that means we would have to use so many more methods names

	ex:
		sumInt(int numOne, int numTwo)
		sumDouble(double, numOne, numTwo)
		sumString(String str, String str2)

	* method that has the same name, but different parameters

		-> allows us to have different methods, different code, but the same name

		overloading happens inside of a class, between methods

	ex:
		substring(start)
		substring(start, end)

		indexOf()

Q: Can you overload a method by changing the return type
	no, methods are overloaded by changing the parameters

Q: After you overload a method, can you change the return type
	yes, after a method is overloaded you can change the return type if you want


    public static void method(){
        System.out.println("default empty method");
    }

	// I will try to overload by changing the return type

	//    public static int method(){
	//
	//    }
	//    this is not valid, changing the return type does not overload

	public static int method(int a){
	        return 0;
	}

var args
variable arguments

	allow you to create methods that accept an array as the parameter, but we can type all the elements directly, separated by commas, without making an array object

	syntax: 

		normal --> 	(int [] nums)
		var args --> (int ... nums)

			ex:	method(element, element, element)

			public static int sum(int ... nums){

			call the method:
			System.out.println(sum(4, 6, 2, 6, 12, 4));

datatype promotion

	whenever you give an argument it will try to match with the specified type

	but if the type is not matched directly it will try to automatically promote to the closest type bigger than it

	byte --> short --> int --> long --> float --> double

	if there is no type available, then the code will not compile

summary:

Method overloading allows methods to be created with the same name
The parameters must be different (number of parameters, or the types of the parameters)
The return types should be the same, but if a method is overloaded it can be changed
Improve re-usability and readability

Git: Keep track of changes

project: B26_Git_Project

right click on project level -> new -> file -> .gitignore

What does the git ignore file do

	any files or folders in this file will not be tracked

Common java files to ignore:
.idea
*.iml
*.xml
/out

# comment with hashtag

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario about versions 

	you do code in office hours
	office hours code was shared to the remote repository
	I wrote code in class
	try to share code to remote repository

		-> faced issue because my project was not the same as the project in the remote repository

	to fix the issue, I should update/or pull my project

		--> now my local repository is the same as the remote repository, so now I can commit and push my changes

	Monday class: 4.0
	Tuesday, office hours: 5.0
	Tuesday, in class: 4.0
		trying to share 4.0 --> 5.0 	
			x doesn't work

		to fix: I need to get version 5.0 to my computer --> update/pull

		now my computer has 5.0 version it means I can share the new code, which would share version 5.2


as a rule: you should always update your projects before pushing
-----------------------------------------------------------------

From the VCS option on the top we select enable version control system integration and pick git

	--> creates a local repository in this project
	--> VCS option becomes Git 

commit the changes so far, which was just the .gitignore

Went to Git option on the top -> Github -> share project

	1) creates a remote repository 
	2) links the local repository with the remote repository 
	3) pushes the first changes/commits

How to open the project on github?
right click on the project level --> open in --> github

created a new package day0
created a new class HelloWorld
wrote some code

commit -> selected the HelloWorld file
push from local repository to remote repository 

Note: The add option window was given to us about if we automatically want to keep track of all files
	if we cancel all files will be created un-versioned 
	if we add then all files will be tracked upon creation

created a new class called First
added some code/comments
commit those changes
go back to the First class and add more changes
commit those changes
after committing there was something wrong with commit message, so we edit it

	-> How to edit: right click on the commit in the git log and select edit commit message

	Note: If you pushed changes already you will not be able to change the commit message. It is not only local now

created the JamesBond.java file on github
	(create an idea that someone else made changes to the same remote repository)
wrote some code

Day 36 Overloading Methods

____________________________________________________________

Overloading methods
____________________________________________________________

Method overloading

How to have methods with similar idea, first we can try with different name:
but that means we would have to use so many more methods names

	ex:
		sumInt(int numOne, int numTwo)
		sumDouble(double, numOne, numTwo)
		sumString(String str, String str2)

	* method that has the same name, but different parameters

		-> allows us to have different methods, different code, but the same name

		overloading happens inside of a class, between methods

	ex:
		substring(start)
		substring(start, end)

		indexOf()

Q: Can you overload a method by changing the return type
	no, methods are overloaded by changing the parameters

Q: After you overload a method, can you change the return type
	yes, after a method is overloaded you can change the return type if you want


    public static void method(){
        System.out.println("default empty method");
    }

	// I will try to overload by changing the return type

	//    public static int method(){
	//
	//    }
	//    this is not valid, changing the return type does not overload

	public static int method(int a){
	        return 0;
	}

var args
variable arguments

	allow you to create methods that accept an array as the parameter, but we can type all the elements directly, separated by commas, without making an array object

	syntax: 

		normal --> 	(int [] nums)
		var args --> (int ... nums)

			ex:	method(element, element, element)

			public static int sum(int ... nums){

			call the method:
			System.out.println(sum(4, 6, 2, 6, 12, 4));

datatype promotion

	whenever you give an argument it will try to match with the specified type

	but if the type is not matched directly it will try to automatically promote to the closest type bigger than it

	byte --> short --> int --> long --> float --> double

	if there is no type available, then the code will not compile

summary:

Method overloading allows methods to be created with the same name
The parameters must be different (number of parameters, or the types of the parameters)
The return types should be the same, but if a method is overloaded it can be changed
Improve re-usability and readability

Git: Keep track of changes

project: B26_Git_Project

right click on project level -> new -> file -> .gitignore

What does the git ignore file do

	any files or folders in this file will not be tracked

Common java files to ignore:
.idea
*.iml
*.xml
/out

# comment with hashtag

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario about versions 

	you do code in office hours
	office hours code was shared to the remote repository
	I wrote code in class
	try to share code to remote repository

		-> faced issue because my project was not the same as the project in the remote repository

	to fix the issue, I should update/or pull my project

		--> now my local repository is the same as the remote repository, so now I can commit and push my changes

	Monday class: 4.0
	Tuesday, office hours: 5.0
	Tuesday, in class: 4.0
		trying to share 4.0 --> 5.0 	
			x doesn't work

		to fix: I need to get version 5.0 to my computer --> update/pull

		now my computer has 5.0 version it means I can share the new code, which would share version 5.2


as a rule: you should always update your projects before pushing
-----------------------------------------------------------------

From the VCS option on the top we select enable version control system integration and pick git

	--> creates a local repository in this project
	--> VCS option becomes Git 

commit the changes so far, which was just the .gitignore

Went to Git option on the top -> Github -> share project

	1) creates a remote repository 
	2) links the local repository with the remote repository 
	3) pushes the first changes/commits

How to open the project on github?
right click on the project level --> open in --> github

created a new package day0
created a new class HelloWorld
wrote some code

commit -> selected the HelloWorld file
push from local repository to remote repository 

Note: The add option window was given to us about if we automatically want to keep track of all files
	if we cancel all files will be created un-versioned 
	if we add then all files will be tracked upon creation

created a new class called First
added some code/comments
commit those changes
go back to the First class and add more changes
commit those changes
after committing there was something wrong with commit message, so we edit it

	-> How to edit: right click on the commit in the git log and select edit commit message

	Note: If you pushed changes already you will not be able to change the commit message. It is not only local now

created the JamesBond.java file on github
	(create an idea that someone else made changes to the same remote repository)
wrote some code
commit the changes on the remote repository (save)
to get the changes from the remote repository to our local repository
	fetch: go the information without making any changes to our project

	Git -> fetch

	update: actually get the changes from the remote repository to our computer, which allows us to run the file now

	Git --> update



Day 35 Return Methods
day35_methods
____________________________________________________________
Method Practice
Utility Classes
____________________________________________________________
recap

return type method
a method: it has some code statement meant to be executed 
many times. It has some action
return type: some value will be given from the method

general syntax:
public static RETURN_TYPE methodName(){
}
creating a method with a return type, which means it is 
not void, there must be a return value given matching the datatype of the 
RETURN_TYPE
--> the value is returned from a method using 
keyword: return
when the return keyword is executed a value is passed 
from the method to where the method was called, and the method stops 
execution

How to call a method that is outside of the package?

1) import the class where the method is created
import packageName.className;
import: keyword
packageName: package where the file 
being used was created
className: class where the method you 
want to use is created

2) use the method by the class name
className.method()

Note: if you are in the same package you don't need to 
import
Note: if you are in the same class you don't need to put 
the class name part

How to import the whole package:
import packageName.*;
* is wildcard. It will import all classes in the defined package
Ex:
import java.util.*;
you can access Scanner or Arrays classes
plus many more

Shortcuts in IntelliJ
search for anything in IntelliJ: shift twice
command/control + shift + f: search for exact text in the files

Quizzes, check quizzes_and_assignments channel
Arrays Short quiz - Tonight
Unit 2 Assessment - Opening Friday
Saturday: java/git
Sunday: java
____________________________________________________________
Recap: Methods
a group of statements that have some action and those actions become 
re-usable anywhere in the project
2 types of methods:
void: executes some action, but it doesn't give any 
information/value back
public static void methodName(){
}
return: execute some actions, and it returns some value
public static RETURN_TYPE methodName(){
}
parameters:
allowing the method to get some data/information to use 
inside of the method
parameters are defined in the parenthesis of a method
--> to add multiple parameters use a comma 
and define:
datatype name, datatype name, etc
any parameter is local to that method
ex:
charAt(index)
charAt(0)
charAt --> method name
(index) --> parameter, some information 
of this type must be given to run the method
(0) --> the 0, or any other number 
given, is the argument - the actual value that will be used in the method 
code
____________________________________________________________
return type
public static RETURN_TYPE methodName(){
}
method that does an action, but it will return/give back 
a single value
RETURN_TYPE: any type
these method use the keyword:
return
-> this keyword with values is how we will 
get information out of the methods
the return keyword also stops the method, because a value 
was passed out of it already
Debugging method
instead of step over, select step into in on the method line, select 
which method you want to debug

Day 33 Void Methods

day33_methods
____________________________________________________________

Void Methods
____________________________________________________________

Recap

	1D Single Dimensional Arrays

		int [] nums = {1, 2, 5}
		String [] words = {"a", "b", "c"}


	2D Array

		array inside of an array - the elements were arrays

		int [][] n = { {2, 3, 5, 6}, {1, 5, 123, 51} };

		n[0] --> {2, 3, 5, 6}
		n[1] --> {1, 5, 123, 51}

		n[0][0] --> 2
		n[0][1] --> 3
		n[0][2] --> 5
		n[0][3] --> 6

		n.length --> 2

		n[0].length --> 4

	loop through 2d array

	for each

		for(int [] arr : n){
			// this loop goes through the 2d array. The elements are arrays

			for(int number : arr){
				// this loop goes through each inner array, which will see each number

			}

		}

	traditional

		for(int i = 0; i < n.length; i++){
			// this loop goes through the 2d array. The elements are arrays
			// to access each array element --> n[i]

			for(int j = 0; j < n[i].length; j++ ){

				// this loop goes through each inner array, which will see each number
				// to access every inner element --> n[i][j]

			}
		}

declaring 2D array

	datatType [][] arrayName = new dataType[x][z];

		where x is how many elements the 2D array has - number of arrays

		where z is the size of each inner array
			-> is optional to define. If it is not defined then the inner arrays sizes do not matter, they can be different

	datatType [][] arrayName = { arrayName1, arrayName2, etc}

	dataType [][] arrayName = { {element, element, element, etc}, {element, element, element, etc}, {element, element, element, etc} };

Q: Why is it giving NullPointerException
String [][] str = new String[2][];  // [ null, null ]
        str [0][0] = "str"; // no array yet, this code will cause problems

       String [] a = {"element", "element"};
       str[0] = a;

       str[1] = new String[]{"element", "element"}

String s = null;
s.charAt(0); --> null.charAt(0) --> NullPointerException

____________________________________________________________

Methods

	a code block that has reusable code

	There is ready methods from java: String methods, Arrays class methods, Scanner method, etc
		-> Code already written and is used by programmers

	We can create our own custom methods, which means we can create reusable code. After writing a method we can call/use the method anywhere in the project

	in other language you may hear function, but in java they are call methods

	Ex:

		public static void hello(){
			System.out.println("Hello");
		}

		public --> access modifier, allows us to call the method in the whole project
			-> Until we say or see anything else, we will use public or our methods

		static --> allows us to call the method by the class name

			className.method()

			-> in the same file, you don't need to give the class name

		void --> no return value. The method will execute some code, but no value is going to come out of it

			Ex: Arrays.sort()

		hello() --> name of the method
			-> Names should be clear about the action of the method

	main method: a special method that is executed when the code is run 

	custom method: will not run by themselves, we have to call/use them somewhere

Parameters:

	to allow our methods to have input we are able to defined parameters

	if a method has a parameter then a value must be given into order to call the method

		-> parameter: name inside of the method

		-> argument: value given to call the method

	the parameters are local variables in the method

		-> the variables cannot be used outside of the method

	you can have multiple parameters by using a comma to separate them 

	there is no restriction to the types, to the number of parameters

	Ex:

		printNumber(int n)  --> method has an int parameter that will be references by the n variable

		to use this method:

		printNumber(5) --> when calling the method an int type value must be given, and that is called the argument

Multidimensional arrays
____________________________________________________________

Arrays Class

	utility class for arrays. Has useful methods/action for array objects

	Ex: int [] n = { 5, 1, 4};


	Arrays.toString(): printing array objects

		Arrays.toString(n) --> [5, 1, 4]

	Arrays.sort(): rearrange elements to be in order of smallest to largest
		-> for String elements: Lexicographical

		Arrays.sort(n) --> [1, 4, 5]

	Arrays.equals(): compare two array objects to see if they have the same elements

		int [] a = {1, 4, 5};
		int [] b = {1, 4, 5, 6};

		Arrays.equals(n, a) --> true   | Remember we sorted the n array
		Arrays.equals(a, b) --> false

String methods:
	
	String.join(): allows the array to be separated by a certain character/s

		String.join("*", n) --> 1*4*5

	--> method works for String array types

____________________________________________________________

More Arrays Class

	Arrays.copyOf()

		two arguments:

			(array, size)

				array: the array you want to copy the elements from
				size: the size of the new array

	Arrays.binarySearch()
		find/search for the position of an element in the array

		--> in order for the method to work, the array must be sorted

		two arguments:
			
			(array, element)	

				array: the sorted array you are checking in
				element: the element you are trying to find the index/position of

		if the element you are looking for is not in the array, then it returns a negative number based on where the position would be + 1

String Methods with Arrays

	toCharArray(): convert a String to a char array, where each elements is every character from the the String

	split(): convert a String to a String array, where each element is the sequence of characters between the given separator

____________________________________________________________

Arrays Class

	https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html

	a class that has methods for arrays

	located in the java.util

		-> so to use this class you must import java.util.Arrays;

	Methods:

		Arrays.toString(arr): allowed us to print arrays objects as a String

			--> array is the argument

			Ex:
				String [] s = {"a", "b", "c"};
				Arrays.toString(s) --> [a, b, c]


		Arrays.sort(arr): sort the elements in ascending order (smallest to largest)

			--> array is the argument

			does not return anything

			for String/character types: lexicographical, means order in ascii table

				special characters --> number --> uppercase (A-Z) --> lowercase(a-z)

				aaa, aab aac

			--> this method does not have a return(nothing to store), it will sort the object
				array object are mutable, you can change the object after making
					-> The size is fixed

		Arrays.equals(arr, arr2): checks if the two given arrays are equal - they have the same elements

			--> two array argument
			--> returns boolean

String method: 

	String.join()

		two arguments:
			String: which characters you want to separate, or be in between the elements 
			array: the data structure where the elements come from

		lets you convert the array object to a String using a different format. You able to define the sequence of characters that will separate the element from the array

Day 30 Arrays

day30_arrays
____________________________________________________________

String methods:
    toCharArray()
    split()
____________________________________________________________

for each loop

    a loop used to iterate through a collection/data structure 

        there is many collections, right now we are using arrays

    it will always iterate through the elements from the beginning to the end

    syntax:

        for(datatype name : array){

        }


        datatype is the type of each element in the array


        name: represent every element during the execution
            in traditional loop the way to get every element is using array[i]


    When to use for each

        - whenever you need to check each element of your array

        - whenever you need to only read values, meaning no values in the array will be changed

    When not to use for each

        - whenever you need to use indexes 

        - whenever you would need to change the array

____________________________________________________________

String methods that are related to arrays

    toCharArray()
        no arguments
        returns a char []

        --> converts the String to a char array

            Ex:
                String s = "abc";
                s.toCharArray() --> [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ];

Note: String class works with char [] internally

    - converting a char [] to a String: 

        using the new String approach of creating an array and giving the char [] as the argument

        ex:
            char [] arr = {'z', 'y', 'x'};

            String str = new String(arr); // "zyx"

    split(): 
        String argument 
        returns a String []     

    --> converts the String into a String [] by separating the String into different parts, which become the elements of the String

    -> the delimiter/separator is not included as an element. This determine how the String will be split it

    most common use case:

        convert a sentence to an array, where every word is an element

        Ex:

            String str = "Today is Monday";
            String [] words = str.split(" ")  --> [Today, is, Monday]

            words[0] --> Today
            words[1] --> is
            words[2] --> Monday

    if you split by empty space
        it returns back a String [] of each character in the String

        Ex:
            String s = "abc";

            s.split("") --> [ "a", "b", "c"];

Day 29 Arrays

day29_array
____________________________________________________________

Array
for each loop
__________________________________________________________

Array: a data structure that holds multiple pieces of information 

	2 ways to make arrays

		datatype [] name = { elements, elements, elements};

		int [] a = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

	or

		datatype [] name = new datatype[size];

		int [] b = new int[5];

		--> When you create an array this way, an empty array is made with default values based on your datatype

			String --> null
			int --> 0
			double --> 0.0
			boolean --> false
			char --> '\u0000' // don't worry about it so much

Read elements from an array

	name[index]  --> gives back the element

Assign/reassign elements in an array

	name[index] = value;

Printing the whole array

	the array object cannot be printed directly in the print statement

	we must use Arrays.toString() method which accepts an array as an argument and returns a String format of our array 

How to iterate through an array

	name[i]   where i is an int number in some loop that will go up by one

__________________________________________________________

For Each Loop

	used with data structures/collections

	so we know arrays

	syntax:

		for(datatype variableName : array/collection){

		}

		action: the loop will iterate through the array on the right side of the colon.
				it goes from the first element to the last elements always
				each iteration the element value will be used in the loop as the variableName defined 

		datatype in the loop declaration is the type of the elements

		ex:

			int [] arr = {10, 20, 30};

			for(int num : arr){
				System.out.println(num);
			}

			iteration 1:
				num would be 10, prints 10

			iteration 2:
				num would be 20, prints 20

			iteration 3:
				num would be 30, prints 30


		traditional loop vs for each loop iteration: 

			array[i] is the same as num in the for each loop

	When should you use for each:

		- if you want to iterate through all the elements

		- read the values

	When can you not use for each:

		- use indexes: to change/update a variable dynamically 
	
		- modify the array in any way

Day 28 Arrays

day28_array
____________________________________________________________

Array
for each loop
____________________________________________________________

Array: a data structure, which is a collection of data in one object

	Before we had normal variables that stored one piece of information at a time 

	In programming working with multiple data is very common

	Arrays are objects

How to create arrays

	there is two ways to make an array

	1) datatype [] arrayName = { element, element, element };

		able to make an array with initial elements. These elements are given between the curly brackets. Each element is separated by a comma

		Ex:

			String [] cities = { "Chicago", "New York" , "Houston", "Denver", "Pittsburgh" };

			int [] nums = { 1, 2, 3, 4};

	2) datatype [] arrayName = new datatype[size];

		able to make an array of a certain size. These elements have a default value. There is elements created for each position made in the array

		Ex: String [] cities = new String[5]; [ null, null, null, null, null ]

			int [] nums = new int[4]; [0, 0, 0, 0]

			boolean [] bool = new boolean[2]; [false, false]

		Default values for array types

			String --> null
			int --> 0
			double --> 0.0
			boolean --> false

		Q: What is the difference between null and "" (empty space)

			null means nothing, for objects
			empty space is a String, but it has no characters

			Scanner input = null; // no actually Scanner object

	Note: 

		int [] name
			vs
		int name []

		both make an array, but the brackets in the middle are preferred 

How to read/use elements from an array

	using the name of the array and the index number you are able to use that element

	arrayName[index] --> gives back the element

How do you know the number of elements

	using the length value

	arrayName.length --> gives back how many elements there is

	Q: What is the difference between length() and length

		length() is a String method to return the number of characters

		length is an array property that returns the number of elements

	Q: How can you access the last element

		last index --> length - 1

		arrayName[ arrayName.length - 1 ]

How to print all the elements in the array

	by default print an array:
		System.out.println(arrayName)

		will show the hash location of the object in the memory

	We must use the Arrays class

		Arrays class is a utility class, which has some useful methods

			in order to use a class we need to import it:
				import java.util.Arrays;

		Arrays.toString() --> returns a String format of the whole array

		System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arrayName));

How to assign/reassign elements in an array

	arrayName[index] = value;

Looping through an array

	in for loop:

		arrayName[i] 

			where i is a variable declared in the loop that iterates 1 index at a time

Nested Loop

	a loop inside of another loop

	ex:

		//outer loop
		for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++){


			// inner loop
			for(int j = 0; j < 2; j++){

			}

		}

		the outer loop will execute for 5 times

		every iteration of the outer loop will execute the inner loop from beginning to end 

			so, how many times total does the inner loop run? 10 times

		i: 0
			j: 0
			j: 1
		i: 1
			j: 0
			j: 1
		i: 2:
			j: 0
			j: 1
		i: 3:
			j: 0
			j: 1

            }

        }


        outer loop: first loop that has another loop inside of it
        	- determines how many executions of the code you want inside of this block

        	- in our example: we wanted to run for 4 times, because there is 4 weeks 

        inner loop: loop inside of another one

        	- treat this as a normal loop that will be executed from beginning to end EACH ITERATION OF THE OUTER LOOP

        	- in our example it means the days will go from 1 to 7 for every week

			if the boolean is true: the statements in the loop will execute 

			if the boolean is false: the loop stop


		3) the code in the loop body is executed - this is one iteration of the statements

Strings with loops

	Q: What does a loop iterating through a String loop like

		for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){


		}

		These are possible ways to write the termination condition:

		i < s.length();
		i <= s.length() - 1;

			ex: String s = "java"
					i < s.length();  i < 4   --> stop before 4 because it is not a valid index
					i <= s.length() - 1; i <= 3  --> stops at the last index of 3

		--> indexes start from 0, so our loop value i is set to start at 0, then it updates by 1 each iteration. The loop will continue as long as the number i is less than the length, which means the loop will only used valid index numbers

	Q: What does a loop look like if you go backward in the String

		for(int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--){


		}

		--> we start our loop from the last index of the String. To get the last index of a String we can use the length - 1. Then the loop will update by subtracting 1 each iteration as long as the number is more than or equal to 0, because those are the valid index numbers

	Q: How to dynamically read each character

		s.charAt(i)

			where i is the variable name declare in the loop

intellij shortcut: fori


	break statement in loop:

		stops and exits the loop

	continue statement in loop:

		it will skip the rest of the iteration and goes to the update part. 
		any code after a continue will not run for that iteration


		ex: 

        for(int i = 1; i <= 100; i++){

            if(i % 2 == 1){

while loop
do while loop
____________________________________________________________

Recap

	Ternary
		types need to match
		type s = boolean (type) ? (type)

	Loops

		repeating some code statements multiple times

	while loop: repeat some code statements using a boolean value. 

		usually used when the number of iterations are not defined.  

		flow/execution order of while loop:

			1) checks the boolean expression

				-> when the boolean is true:

					execute the statements inside of the while block (inside of the curly brackets), top to bottom

					the loop goes back to step 1)

				-> when the boolean is false:

					the loop stops. the code resume execution from after the loop

	iteration: one cycle/execution of the code

	infinite loop: the loop continues to run, with no stop

		-> in while loop it means the boolean will never be false, it stays always true

		avoid infinite loops


do while

    similar to the while loop but the first iteration/execution always happens no matter the boolean expressions 

    do{

        // statements

    } while(boolean_expression);

__________________________________________________________

[Middle char]
	Given a String, write a program to display the middle character of a string
	a) If the length of the string is even there will be two middle characters. b) If the length of the string is odd there will be one middle character.
	Ex:
	Input: elephant
	Output: The middle characters: ph

__________________________________________________________

Loops

	Loops in programming are used to repeat statements multiple times

	Loop types: 

		while loop, do while loop, for loop, for each loop

	while loop: loop that continues to run as long as the boolean value is true

	syntax:

		while(boolean_expression){

			// statements that are repeated

		} // while loop ending point

	while loop execution flow:

		boolean expression is checked

			-> if the boolean is true

				the loop will run, which means the code inside of the while loop are executed top to bottom

				then it goes back up to check the boolean expression again

			-> if the boolean is false: the loop will stop

	infinite loop: a loop that will continue to run, over and over again without stopping. The boolean will never be false

	iteration: each cycle of the loop. The statements are run each time you iterate

Day 20 String Practice

day20_string
___________________________________________________________________

Recap

	general syntax to use methods: 	stringObject.method()

	Index: a number position. Every character in a String has an index
		indexes start from 0

		String s = "apple";
					01234

	charAt(int index): returns the character at the given index
		ex:	s.charAt(0) --> 'a'
			s.charAt(3) --> 'l'
			s.charAt(6) --> StringIndexOutOfBoundsException	

				-> If you use any index that is not valid you will get the exception/error

	indexOf(): returns the index (int) based on the given argument

		(char): return the index where the given char is found in the String. It returns the first occurrence of that character

			ex:
				s.indexOf('a') --> 0
				s.indexOf('p') --> 1
				s.indexOf('z') --> -1

					-> When a char is not found in the String, it returns -1

		(String): returns the index of the character sequence in the String. It returns the index where the sequence starts

			ex:
				s.indexOf("ppl") --> 1
				s.indexOf("le") --> 3
				s.indexOf("pear") --> -1
				s.indexOf("a") --> 0

		(char, int): it returns the index of the given char, but it starts looking at the given int index number

				ex:
					String a = "applep"
								012345
					a.indexOf('p', 2) --> 2
					a.indexOf('p', 3) --> 5

		(String, int)

	lastIndexOf(): returns the index (int) based on the given argument, but it checks from the end of the String

		ex:

			s.lastIndexOf('p') --> 2

	substring(): returns part of a String based on the arguments

		(int): return the String characters starting from the given index (starting point) until the end of the String. This given index is included in the resulting String

			Ex:

				String str = "monday";
							  012345

				str.substring(3) --> day
				str.substring(1) --> onday
				str.substring(10) --> StringIndexOutOfBoundsException

		(int, int): returns the String characters from the first argument (index) until the second argument (index). The first index is included in the resulting String, but the second index is not included (the stopping point)

				String str = "monday";
							  012345

				str.substring(2, 5) --> nda
				str.substring(2, 6) --> nday
				str.substring(2, 7) --> StringIndexOutOfBoundsException

		these two code do similar thing

		s.charAt(0)  -> gives char type

		s.substring(0,1) -> gives String type

how to convert any type to String

	concatenate a space

	usually empty space ""


        // ( "" + firstName.charAt(0)).method --> this will also give you the first character, but as a char type


    replace(): allows you to change a certain character/s to another character/s. Replaces all occurrences of those characters in the String

    	(char, char): first char is the value you are trying to change and the second char is the value you are changing it to 

    		Ex:
    			String a = "apple";
    			a.replace('p', 'z') --> azzle

    	(String, String): first String is the value you are trying to change and the second String is the value you are changing it to

    		String str = "today is monday";
    		str.replace(" ", "") --> todayismonday

    		str.replace("monday", "tuesday") -> today is tuesday

    replaceFirst(): replaces the first occurrence of the characters

Recap

String methods:

    general syntax: stringObject.method()

    equals(): checks if the Strings value/objects have the same characters
        -> cares about case sensitivity

        returns boolean

    equalsIgnoreCase(): checks if the String value/object have the same characters, but it ignores case sensitivity

        returns boolean

    length(): checks and returns the number of characters

        -> spaces are characters

        returns int

    toUpperCase(): converts all the characters in the String to uppercase letters

        returns String

    toLowerCase(): converts all characters in the String to lowercase letters

        returns String

    startsWith(""): checks if the String starts with the characters given in the parenthesis

        returns boolean

    endsWith(""):  checks if the String ends with the characters given in the parenthesis

        return boolean

    contains(""): checks if the String has the given character sequence in it

        returns boolean

    isEmpty(): checks if your String has characters or not. If there is no characters, it is empty

        return boolean

    isBlank(): checks if your String has non white space characters or not. If there is only white spaces it is blank

        return boolean

    trim(): removes spaces in the beginning and end
        -> spaces anywhere between other characters are not removed

        return String

____________________________________________________________

Indexes

    every character in a String has a position where it is located called an index

    index numbers start from 0

    Q: How can I find the last index of a String

        length - 1

        Why does that work? Because index starts from 0

    method(_______)  <-- when you give some information in the parenthesis of a method it is called an argument

    charAt(index): returns the character at the given index number

        returns char

    substring(): returns part of a String

        (int): the returned String starts from the given index number until the end of the String.

        (int, int): the returned String starts from the first given index number until the second given index number. The first index is included, but the last index is not included in the characters

        Ex: 
        String s = "abc";
        s.substring(1) --> bc

    indexOf(): returns the index number of the given char/String argument

        returns int

        -> if you try to find a character that does not exist in the String, the method will return -1

        (char): it will find the first occurrence of the given character in the String and returns the index of that character

        (String): it will find the first occurrence of the given character sequence (String) and it returns the index of the first character of that sequence

        (char/String, int): it will find the char/String (first argument) in the String starting from the index of the second argument

Later:

    lastIndexOf()

    replace()

    replaceFirst()

Day 18 String

day18_string
____________________________________________________________

Recap
String class
__________________________________________________________

String 

	String is a class, so we make objects to use it

		-> holds multiple characters 

	the class is found in the java.lang package

		-> is imported automatically 

2 ways to create String objects

	1) String literal: using double quotations with nothing else
		Ex: String s = "Saturday";

		-> made in the String pool

	2) new keyword: new String("");
		Ex: String s = new String("Saturday");

Memory

	Stack: references (variable name)

	Heap: objects (variables), String pool

	String pool: a special memory location for String literals. It saves memory by not having to make Strings over and over again 

String is immutable: String objects cannot be changed after being created


--> to compare Strings we should never use == 

	== with Strings compare the objects to each other

String methods:

	general syntax: stringObject.method()

	equals(): checks if the Strings value/objects have the same characters
		-> cares about case sensitivity

		returns boolean

	equalsIgnoreCase(): checks if the String value/object have the same characters, but it ignores case sensitivity

		returns boolean

	length(): checks and returns the number of characters

		-> spaces are characters

		returns int

	toUpperCase(): converts all the characters in the String to uppercase letters

		returns String

	toLowerCase(): converts all characters in the String to lowercase letters

		returns String

	startsWith(""): checks if the String starts with the characters given in the parenthesis

		returns boolean

	endsWith(""):  checks if the String ends with the characters given in the parenthesis

		return boolean

	contains(""): checks if the String has the given character sequence in it

		returns boolean

	isEmpty(): checks if your String has characters or not. If there is no characters, it is empty

		return boolean

	isBlank(): checks if your String has non white space characters or not. If there is only white spaces it is blank

		return boolean

	trim(): removes spaces in the beginning and end
		-> spaces anywhere between other characters are not removed

		return String

__________________________________________________________

ask the user to enter a message
clean the message for empty spaces in the beginning and end
check the message for bad phrases:
	
	java is bad
	quit
	have fun
	crying

if there is a bad phrase in the message print:
	
	message failed to send

otherwise print:

	$message sent

Day 17 String

day17_string
____________________________________________________________

String class
Start String methods
____________________________________________________________

String

	String is a class 
		the class is in package: java.lang	
			-> java.lang is automatically imported 

	-> Scanner class was in java.util

	Strings are object types, not primitive data types
		object types (non primitive)

	immutable: cannot change it

	-> in java: an immutable object cannot be changed after it is made. The value cannot be changed

	Memory 

	in general: 
		hard drive storage - where you store data

		ram: memory used by the computer

		Stack: variable names/reference 

		Heap: objects are stored

			String pool:
				located in the heap

				it is a special memory location for String literals

	2 ways to create String objects

		- String literal

			just giving double quotations

		- new keyword

			using new String("value");


Q: What is the difference between == and .equals()

	== compares the objects in the memory

	.equals() compares the value, meaning the characters 


String methods:

	equals():	compares two Strings and give a boolean
		it gives true if the String characters are exactly the same. 

	equalsIgnoreCase(): compare two Strings and given a boolean
		it gives true if the String characters are the same characters, while ignoring case sensitivity 

	length(): gives an int of how many characters are in the String

		Q: Are spaces characters: yes. Counts as a character for the length method

________________________________________________________________

Switch

	control flow statement that allows us match values via cases. Checks if the given value is equal to any defined case 

	switch(value){

		case possible_value: 
			// statements
			break;
		default:
			// statements

	}

	case possible_value: expected value that you are checking equality with. Datatype matches the value datatype
 
		valid datatypes: byte, short, int, String, char

		invalid datatypes: float, double, boolean, long

		cannot have duplicates cases. cases must be unique

	break: stops the switch statement

	default: case that is executed if no other case matches

		it be anywhere in the switch 

	Execution flow:

		takes the value and tries to match it with a case. If the case is there, the statements are executed from that point, top to bottom, until the end of the switch or a break statement

	What is the difference between if, switch, and ternary

		if statements:
			in most cases if statements are used for controlling the flow of a program

			work with boolean logic

			able to use all datatypes

			multiple types that handle multiple different scenarios


		switch statements:
			can only compare values, check if the values are equal

			when the cases are known, when there is a fixed number of exact possible values


		ternary:

			used sometimes when there is simple boolean logic and a value must be given back
				the value is usually assigned to a variable or used right away

				- cannot be used when there is only one possible outcome

____________________________________________________________

switch statements
____________________________________________________________

Switch

conditional statement: controlling the program 

	switch statements only compare exact values ==

		-> relational operators ( > < >= <= !=) are not allow in switch

	switch(variable) {

		case x:
			// statements
			break;

		default:

	}

	switch: keyword to make a switch statement

	variable: value being checked/compared in the switch
		on these types are allowed as the input variable: byte, short, int, char, String

		which means these types are not allowed as the input variable: float, double, long, boolean

	case: value that you are checking for. The datatype of the case should match the datatype of the variable being checked

	statements: any code you want to run when the case matches

	break: stops and exits the switch statement

	default: case when no other cases match

		example:

			int a = 3;

			switch(a) {

				case 1:
					// statements
					break;
				case 2:
					// statements
					break;
				case 3:
					System.out.println("Three");
					break;
			}

	Execution Flow

		if statements: go top to bottom. Checks each condition one at a time until a condition is true or there is no more conditions

		switch statement: the case matches first, then the statements are executed, top to bottom, from that case until the end of the switch or break key-words.


Declare: price and calories variables

Ask the user to enter which size drink they want

Based on the drink size determine the price and calories of the order

	data:

		size: tall
		price: 2.50
		calories: 100

		size: grande
		price: 4.00
		calories: 150

		size: venti

____________________________________________________________

multi branch if statements
if without brackets
ternary
__________________________________________________________

Recap

	Q: When to use multi branch statements: 
		when you have multiple conditions that you want to check and when those statements are related to each other

	if (condition) {
		// if the condition is true, this code will run
	} else if(condition 2){
		// if the condition 2 is true, this code will run
	} else if(condition 3){
		// if the condition 3 is true, this code will run
	} else {
		// if all the conditions were false, then this code will run
	}

	Q: How many else if can you have
		as many as you want

	Q: How many else can you have
		only one at the end

	Q: Is else block mandatory 
		no, it possible to have just single if statement

	Multi branch if statements will execute top to bottom like other code, the condition will be checked and if there is a true condition that code block will be executed and if statement will be done

	Q: What if there is more than 1 true statement
		since the code goes from top to bottom, the first true statement will decide which code block will be run

	single if vs multi branch

		single if: for each if statement each condition is checked

			if(){

			}

			if(){

			}

		multi branch: each if condition will be checked, until there is a true result

			if(){

			} else if(){

			}

__________________________________________________________

if statements without brackets

	you can create if statements without brackets

		with brackets:

			if(4 > 5){
				System.out.println("hello");
			}

		without brackets:

			if(4 > 5)
				System.out.println("hello");

	when there is an if statement without brackets, only the line after it is the if block
	without brackets, you cannot have more than one line of code in that if block

	suggestion: don't be lazy, always use brackets

__________________________________________________________

Ternary 

	a way to write an if statement quickly

	syntax:

		resultVariable = boolean_expression ? trueValue : falseValue;

			? -> if, but it comes after boolean

			: -> else

	ex:
		int score = 90;

		if(score > 75){
			System.out.println("pass");
		} else {
			System.out.println("fail");
		}


		-------

		int score = 90;
		String result;

		if(score > 75){
			result = "pass";
		} else {
			result = "fail";
		}

		System.out.println(result);

		-------
		int score = 90;
		String result;

		result = score > 75 ? "pass" : "fail";

What is debugging:
	to find the reason of your issue/error in the code, you are able to check line by line

Debug:
	
	1) create a breakpoint by clicking on the gray bar next to the code lines

	2) click the on the green run button, but select the debug option

	3) then to progress from line to line you can click the step over button (execute 1 line at a time)

	4) Debugger window/ Console: you can swap between the windows to see the console and the debugger information

		if / else statement

		multi branch if statement if/ else if / else

		nested if

	single if

		if(boolean_expression){
			// statements
		}

		when the boolean expression is true -> the statements inside of the if block will be executed

		when the boolean expression if false -> nothing will happen, the code will resume execution after the if statement

	if else 

		if(boolean_expression) {
			// statements for if block
		} else {
			// statements for else block
		}

		when the boolean expression is true -> the statements inside of the if block will be executed

		when the boolean expression is false -> the statements inside of the else block will be executed

	What is the difference between the single if statement and the if else statement?

		For both the if block is executed if the boolean is true

		but when the boolean is false

			single if: nothing happens

			if else: else block runs

Day 10 Scanner

day10_scanner
____________________________________________________________

Scanner
Practice
__________________________________________________________

Recap

Scanner 

	hard code: values directly in the code

		ex: int a = 450; // 450 is hard coded

		ex: String url = "www.google.com";

	dynamic values: value that come from outside of the code
		ex: Scanner, website, db, file

		ex: int b = SCANNER CODE;

	Scanner is a class that allows us to get values from the console. The Scanner methods allow us to type into the console and depending on the method, we are able to get different datatypes.

	class: java file, has methods and variables. Non primitive datatype

	method: group of code, has some functionality 

		ex: nextInt() method allows us to type a number in the console and save it to a variable or use it

	How do you use the Scanner and its methods

		1) import the class

			to use a file from a different package we must import the file we want to use

			general syntax:

				import package name.class name;

				popular names for Scanner: scan, input, scanner, keyboard

			for Scanner:

				import java.util.Scanner;
			
			-> imports go between the package and the class

					PIC: order of the java file content: package, import, class

			-> What about String?

				String class is in a different package, how are we using it?

				package: java.lang is automatically imported

		2) make a Scanner object (declare a Scanner variable)

				syntax:

					Scanner name = new Scanner(System.in);


				-> only declared once in each class

		3) use the Scanner methods with the name you declared

			ex:

				name.method()

				Scanner methods:

					nextByte()
					nextShort()
					nextInt()
					nextLong()
					nextFloat()
					nextDouble()
					nextBoolean()

					next(): gives you a String, but it only accepts one word

					nextLine(): gives you a String, but it allows multiple words. This method also accepts enter inputs


				problem:

					whenever we use nextLine() method after any other Scanner methods the input is consumed by the enter from the previous input

				solution:

					add an extra nextLine() just to handle the enter input, then you can use nextLine() to read a String value

	char

		a single character in a single quote ' '
		every character has a number related to it

	boolean

		true or false

	String

		multiple characters in double quotations " "

		concatenation: whenever anything/any type is concatenated with a String, the result becomes a String and the two data are put together

		String is not a primitive datatype. its a class

	Type casting

		changing the datatype from one to another

		order:  [SMALL] byte -> short -> int -> long -> float -> double [LARGE]

		Smaller datatype --> Larger datatype	
			Widening convention happens automatically

			int --> double

		Larger datatype --> Smaller 
			Narrowing convention happens manually

			double --> int

		Formula to cast:
			datatype variable = (datatype you are casting to) variable/value

			Data loss: sometimes when going from a bigger number to a smaller number or a decimal number to a whole number there can be data loss, which means the value is changed

		char <> int

------------------------------------------------------------
Create a class House
    create a main method

    - Each the datatype you feel is most appropriate for each variable. 

    - Create the following variables:
        house type, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, number of kitchens, is there a basement?, is there an attic, is there a pool, is the house for sale?, cost of the house, address, zipcode, is a park near by, Rating of surrounding school districts (out of 5), 

    - Print each variable with a message with the value
        Ex: The number of bedrooms is: 4
            The number of bathrooms is: 3

Arithmetic Operators

	+ addition
	- subtraction
	* multiplication
	/ division
	% remainder/modulus

	When you use arithmetic operators between two different datatypes the result will be the bigger type.

	- When you use datatypes like short or byte and use some arithmetic operators the values are changed to int, so the result of the operation is also int

Recap

	What are variables?

		container/storage that holds information/data/values

		-> Why do we need variables: improves re-usability, reduces repetitive code. Also it makes easier to change the information

		-> Can you store a variable in another variable: it will assign the value from the first variable to the other one

	How to declare variables

		Create a container that can store data and you clarify the type of data that it will store. Must declare before using it. Creates the variable name that is used to access the data.

		-> How do you access variables: you give the variable name, with no quotations

		- syntax:

			dataType variableName

			int age;

	How to assign to variables

		Puts a value(data/information) into a variable using the assignment operator =

		- syntax:

			variableName = value

			age = 10;

	How to declare and assign variables

		Instead of creating the variable and storing information into the variable at separate time, it is done at the same time

		- syntax:

			dataType variableName = value

	Naming rules for variables

		use any letter (A-Z or a-z)
		contains numbers (0-9), but can't start with a number
			can have: age2
			cannot have: 2age
		special characters: dollar sign $ and underscore _
		no reserved words
		no spaces
		cannot have repeating names, names must be unique
		should follow camel case:
			starts with lowercase and every other word in the name should start with a uppercase

	How to reassign

		change the value in a variable. Updates the value

	How to concatenate variables with characters

		add a group of characters in double quotations with a variable using the plus operator + 

		When you concatenate with a String, the result is a String

	What are the datatypes types

		in java there is primitive datatypes and non primitive types

		- we will learn non primitive later

		what kind of information

	What are primitive datatypes

		whole numbers (Integers)
			byte
			short
			int 		<- default type by compiler
			long

		floating numbers (Decimal numbers)
			float
			double		<- default type by compiler

		character
			char : holds a single character

				-> each character is represented in a single quote 'a'

			unicode: character have numbers related to them
				ASCII - part of unicode

		boolean

			boolean: true or false statements

	Non primitive datatype

			String
				not a primitive datatype. Class

				holds multiple characters using the double quotations

				concatenations vs addition
					String + String -> concatenation
					String + number -> concatenation
						values of the String and number type are combined, output value is String
					String + char -> concatenation
						values of the String and a char are combined, output value is String
					number + number -> addition 
					char + char -> addition 

				Q: What is the difference between 'a' and "a"

					the types are different. The 'a' is a char type and the "a" is a String type

Task

	create a class MyName
	create a main method
	create multiple char variables, one for each letter of your name
	print your name 
		print each letter in a different line
		print your name in the same line

____________________________________________________________

Task

	create a class CellPhone
	create a main method
	declare and assign these variables:
		brand, model, color, price, storage, hasCamera, sim(char A, B, C)

	Print all the variables

		sample data: apple, iphone 10, black, 1000.99, 128, true, A

____________________________________________________________

Task

	create a class EmployeeInfo
	create a main method
	declare and assign these variables:
		first name, last name, gender, age, company name, are the full time, job title, salary, number of pto (0-25), are they married, suite(char - A, B, C, D)

	Print all the variables
____________________________________________________________

	In numbers you can use underscore to make the number more readable

	java doesn't allow you to type commas in number

		Example:
			1,000,00

			java: 1_000_000

____________________________________________________________

Type casting

	Convert from one primitive datatype to another

		- going from a smaller datatype to a bigger datatype happens automatically

				int i = 40;
				long l = i;

		- going from a bigger datatype to a smaller datatype needs manually casting

				long l = 100;
				int i = (int) l;


		Casting Formula:
				smallerDatatype varName = (smallerDatatype) biggerDatatypeValue

Recap

	Comments

		text directly in the code, it is used to explain the code, have reminders of what it does

		does not get executed

		-> When there is an issue in the code, we can comment out the code as well

		types:

			// single line comment - comments one lines

			/* multi line comment - comments multiple lines */

			/** java docs comment - comments multiple lines with more functionality */

		TODO: allows you to create a reminder, intellij has a built in feature to show all todo comments

	Escape Sequences 

		allows to use certain characters that are also part of java syntax

		\'	'
		\"	"
		\\	\
		\n	new line
		\t	tab
____________________________________________________________

Shortcut to comment

command/control + /

____________________________________________________________

Variables

	container to hold data/information

	allow the values of information to changed, used multiple times

	Declare a variable: makes a container/variable ready to be used

		dataType variablName;
		int age;

	Assign a value to a variable: store some value/number into your container

		variableName = value;
		age = 10;

	Declaring and assigning at the same time

		dataType variableName = value;
		int age = 10;

DataTypes

	In java there is many types. 

	Primitive datatypes: byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char

	Object types: (we will spend more time on this later)
		-> String

	-> all primitives are lowercase

		whole numbers: (ex: 40)
			byte
			short
			int   <- by default
			long
		floating numbers: (ex: 24.62)
			float
			double  <- by default

	-> compiler uses int and double by default

	How to tell the compiler you want long number: use an 'L' at the end of the number
	How to tell the compiler you want float number: use an 'F' at the end of the number

concatenation

	we can use + to add variables to characters, to make a message

reassigning

	changing the value something else, old value is lost. Updating the variable


Q: Can you write numbers starting with 0
	
	no, it becomes a different number
	for whole numbers

Hardcoded: directly in the code, so it is difficult to change

shortcut for printing variables: soutv

Need to talk about:
floating numbers
concatenation
reassigning
variable naming rules

class name Olympics

create a variable for the year
print the country and year for next couple events
reassign year value each time. Country name is hard coded

data:
	
	China 2022
	France 2024
	Italy 2026

Look forward to the year $year for the Olympics to be in $location

Task:

	class name: School

declare and assign these variables
	number of students in grade 1
	number of students in grade 2
	number of students in grade 3
	number of students in grade 4
	number of students in grade 5

	total number of students in your school

	number of days in a year (have some half day = ~ 100.5)
	number of snow days in a year (double)
	average gpa in school (3.5) [ranges 1.0 - 4.0]

	print all of the variables with unique messages

____________________________________________________________

Variable naming rules

	- make the variable names are clear as possible
		dont do:

			int x;
			int a;

	- Variables can contains these:
		- any letter (A-Z, or a-z)
		- any number (0-9)
		- only special characters allowed are dollar sign $ and underscore _

	- for multiple words: use camel case.
		each new word starts with an uppercase

			words: today is saturday
			camel case: todayIsSaturday
			Pascal case( class names) TodayIsSaturday

	- don't use reserved words

	- Can't start with a number
		int 1age --> invalid
		int age1 --> valid

____________________________________________________________

Warm up:

	- Create todays package: day03_comments_escape_sequence

	- Create a new class in todays package: Goals

		- Create a main method

		- Using print statements print out 3 different goals you have for yourself in this course. Print each on a different line

____________________________________________________________

Recap

If you don't have group: 
	Omer#9709
	Guljannat#2209

	Canvas

	IntelliJ

		project: folder where all the other files are in

		src: source folder, where we will write java code

		package: folders in src, that will organize/group code

		java class: .java file that will have java code

		main method: a place to write and run code

			code: public static void main (String [] args) {}

			shortcut in Intellij: main

		console: window that shows the output of your code

		out: folder that stores your bytecode. DO NOT TOUCH

	Print statements

		Code: System.out.println();

			this allows us to output something to the console

		How do we print letters/characters: double quotations ""

		shortcut in Intellij: sout

	- Java is case sensitive
	- Java is not space sensitive

	How to change the name of something:

		right click -> refactor -> rename
____________________________________________________________

Github

	See all the code we do together, online

	Go to okta -> click the github enterprise button -> Java Programming Project -> src -> package -> code

____________________________________________________________

println() vs print()

	System.out.println(); 

		prints whats given to the console. Then goes to the next line

	System.out.print();	

		prints whats given to the console, but all in the same line

		-> Cannot be used without input

____________________________________________________________

Comments

	in our java files we can write comments which are just text that will not be executed(run)
		-> compiler ignores these lines because they are not code

	Comments are used to explain the code. Creates notes, reminders

	Comments helps with documentation 

	Q: When you use comments do you need quotation marks: No, because it is not code

Types of comments

	- Single line comments: comments everything in that line

		syntax: 

			// comments this whole line

	- multi line comments:  allows us to write multiple lines of text

		syntax:

			/*
				any number of lines 
				can be be put between
				the syntax
			*/

	- Java doc comments: similar to multi line comments, so it allows you to write comments in multiple lines, but this provides extra function for html documentation

		syntax:

			/**
			*
			*
			*/

	- TODO: allows you to create reminders. IntelliJ has separate window to keep track of all the todos on the bottom left corner

	view -> tool windows -> todo

____________________________________________________________

Escape Sequence

Q: How can you output this:

		I like "java" programming

We can use the backslash to define a character we want to output
	
	\

	for example: if we want to output a " quotation mark we can do:
		\"

	for example: if we want to output a \ backslash we can do:
		\\

	some more useful escape characters:

		code 	-> output
		\" 		-> "
		\\ 		-> \
		\'		-> '
		\n 		-> next line
		\t 		-> tab

	- Escape sequences are using in quotations

____________________________________________________________

Todo: 
	
	watch short videos
	practice tasks
	get good sleep on Friday

Day 2 Intellij & Print Statements

day02_print_statements
____________________________________________________________

Intellij Set Up
Print Statements
First Java Program
____________________________________________________________

Recap:

	What do computer understand:
		binary (0s and 1s)

	input -> [process/algorithm] -> output

	algorithm: step by step of how to solve the problem

	code (high level) -> compile/interpret (translates) -> machine level (low level)

	File.java -> compiler -> File.class (bytecode) -> JVM will translate and run

		-> Where does the compiler come from: JDK

		-> Whats the point of having the middle step of bytecode: it means you ran run java code anywhere there is a JVM (Platform independent)
____________________________________________________________

Project name: Java_Programming_B26

By default all projects are made in a folder called IdeaProjects
	
	this folder is under your user


IntelliJ project components

	project name: Project folder

	src: source folder

	package: folder

	class: java file

	console: window that shows your outputs

	out: folder that has the bytecode

	IntelliJ saves automatically

Class: HelloWorld
	no space

Java is not space sensitive  (in the code)
Java is case sensitive (the lowercase and uppercase letter matter)

What is this

	public static void main (String [] args) {
		

	}

	-> main method: allows you to run code

	-> When do you make main method: in every class, every separate file in only have one main method

What is this

	System.out.println();  

	-> lets your output something to console


We use quotation marks to display characters

	is space a character -> yes

Task: 	create a new java file called: TellMeAboutYourSelf under day2 package

		add a main method

		try and print your name

Shortcuts:

	main method: main or psvm

	printing: sout


How to rename things
	for packages, for classes

	right click -> refactor -> rename

Task:
	
	add more code to TellMeAboutYourself

		try to add more lines that print:

			- where you live
			- a hobby you enjoy
			- a random number

Task:
	
	create a class called MyTriangle under the day 2 package

	try to print a triangle

		 *
		* *
	   *****

Naming conventions
	
	package: lowercase, no spaces. to separate words you can use underscore. 
		periods/dot for sub package

	class: Pascal Case - Words are together with no spaces, Each word starts with uppercase letter

		words: today we learned java


		normal: todaywelearnedjava

		camel case: todayWeLearnedJava
			first letter is lowercase and the rest of the words start with an uppercase

		Pascal Case: TodayWeLearnedJava

Github: place where we will store code

Todo:

	Make sure you have github access on okta, if you don't contact support

	Finish watching the rest of the short videos
		Single line & multi line comments
		Escape Sequences

	A little practice with making classes, main method and print statements

	45 - 50 minutes (review/recap)
	15 minute break
	45 - 50 minutes
	15 minute break
	45 - 50 minutes

What im using: Sublime text

____________________________________________________________

binary:
	language that the computer understands

	made of 0s and 1s

ASCII: American Standard Code for Information Interchange

	every character has a number related to it

	A -> 65

How do you represent 5 as binary?
	
	101 == 5

	011 == 3

What is an algorithm?
	
	step by step solution to a problem

pseudocode: step by step solution what the code should do, but it isn't code. It is in English 

How does a computer understand our needs/action

	We write high level code (human understandable)

	Translated: compile / interpret

	Turns to low level code so computer can understand (machine level)

Java can be used in many ways, but our focus is on automation

Where do programmers write code?
	
	any text file

	IDE: integrated development environment 

		-> a tool to help us write code

		we will use IntelliJ

How does java work:
	
	write code 		-> 	compile 	-> bytecode
	(.java)								(.class)

	bytecode runs in the jvm. The jvm translates to binary		

Symbols:

	{ } curly brackets
	[ ] square brackets
	( ) parentheses
	 ;  semi colon

File:  stores some data

extensions:

	.doc
	.pdf
	.ppt
	.png
	.img
	.txt

	.java
	.class

What is the different between JDK, JRE, JVM

	JDK: Java development kit	
		allows you to write java code
		contains the JRE and JVM, and compiler

	JRE: Java runtime environment
		contains JVM, JRE libraries(files), which allows java code to be run

	JVM: Java virtual machine
		runs the java code
		interprets

____________________________________________________________

Typing:
	typing.com
	typeracer
	ztype

Shortcuts:

			mac / windows
	
	copy: command/control + c

	paste: command/control + v

	cut: command/control + x

	undo: command/control + z

	save: command/control + s

	screenshot: 

		mac:
			command + shift + 5

		windows:
			windows key + shift + s
____________________________________________________________
